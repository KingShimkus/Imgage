A application that allows users to draw on an image together at the same time. I want this Node.js application to be kind of a starter application for people just getting into Node and npm. If you have any problems or just want to chat feel free to do so.

# Node and NPM
In order for installation to run as smoothly as possible make sure you download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your computer before you begin installation. 

# Installation

1. Installation through Terminal begins with cloning this repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KingShimkus/Imgage.git
  ```

2. Then you want to `cd` into, like so:

  ```
  cd Imgage/
  ```

3. Once you are inside the the folder, install package dependencies: 

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

4. And finally, to run the application:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

5. Then make your way over to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and enjoy. :)

# About

Based off of [this](https://github.com/eddanger/Multi-Touch-Multi-User-Canvas) repository made my [Eddanger](https://github.com/eddanger). I found it on the [Open Source Projects](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/projects,-applications,-and-companies-using-node) page and it helped a lot while I was learning Node. I just added a lot more, and made it more user friendly.
