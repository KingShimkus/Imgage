A application that allows users to draw on an image or graph together at the same time. WIth options such as brush size and brush color. Imgage is an simple Node application with a lot of possibilities for expansion. 

## Motivation

The Imgage project started as a fork of [this](https://github.com/eddanger/Multi-Touch-Multi-User-Canvas) amazing repository made my [Eddanger](https://github.com/eddanger).  Found on the [Open Source Projects](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/projects,-applications,-and-companies-using-node) page, it taught me everything I know about Node.
