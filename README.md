A application that allows users to draw on an image together at the same time. I want  this Node.js application to be kind of a starter application for people just getting into Node and npm. If you have any problems or just want to chat feel free to do so.

# Node and NPM
In order for installation to run as smoothly as possible make sure you download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your computer before you begin installation. 

# Installation

Installation through Terminal begins with cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KingShimkus/Imgage.git
```

Then you want to `cd` into, like so:

```bash
cd Imgage/
```

Once you are inside the the folder, install package dependencies: 

```bash
npm install
```

And finally, to run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Then make your way over to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and enjoy drawing.
